This directory contains accounts for testing.
The passphrase that unlocks them is "foobar".

The "good" key files which are supposed to be loadable are:

- File: UTC--2018-07-12T05-33-36.306013000Z--e1f804d023ae2a5c12e7585c8e7a286766646a6a
  Address: 0xe1f804d023ae2a5c12e7585c8e7a286766646a6a
- File: aaa

- File: zzz
  Address: 0x58b972aedadb22d4b65e8f9fe77073f90517b791

The other files (including this README) are broken in various ways
and should not be picked up by package accounts:

- File: no-address (missing address field, otherwise same as "aaa")
- File: garbage (file with random data)
- File: empty (file with no content)
- File: swapfile~ (should be skipped)
- File: .hiddenfile (should be skipped)
- File: foo/... (should be skipped because it is a directory)
